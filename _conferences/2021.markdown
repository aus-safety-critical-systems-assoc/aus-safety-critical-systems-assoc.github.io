## Submit a Paper
The Australian System Safety Virtual Conference (ASSC) is organised by the Australian Safety Critical Systems Association (aSCSa), a Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society. ​

The theme for the 2021 virtual conference is “Complex Systems: Can We Keep It Safe Anymore?”. With systems becoming more integrated, networked, and complex – incorporating new/emerging technologies, automation, autonomy, and artificial intelligence – ‘system of systems’ challenges such as emergent behaviour, cybersecurity, and human factors become more prominent.
- Are traditional Safety by Design programs and system review constructs sufficient?
- How do we understand and analyse these complex systems and architectures?
- How do we provide safety assurance for complex, emergent behaviour, and potentially adaptive systems?
- How do we ensure cybersecurity and human factors issues are adequately assessed and integrated with the safety program?

The 2021 ASSC would like to examine and share the latest thinking on the state of the art and its fitness for purpose. We invite research papers and project experience to present and engage.

### ​Topics of Interest

The conference invites original and unpublished works that advance the state-of-the-art in safety and security considerations for the development and operation of safety and security critical systems. We are particularly interested in cross-industry and cross-pollenisation, and looking for papers in:
- Medicine and health (medical devices, e-health systems, etc.)
- Transport
- Defence and Aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy
- Security
- Resource and process industries
- Emergency services

Delegates have the option of submitting two types of papers:
1. Refereed Papers by the conference program committee
2. Industry Presentations/Papers (not subject to peer review)

Both types of papers are published on the conference website, and if sufficient papers are submitted, published in the Journal of Safety and Reliability Society.

### Submission
- Abstracts should be approximately 250 words.
- For delegates who optionally submit a full paper - papers should be no more than 10 pages.
- Paper submissions can be emailed to [program@ascsa.org.au](mailto:program@ascsa.org.au)

### Important Dates
- Abstract: **12th Mar 2021** (text, rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Submission: **16th Apr 2021** (rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Camera-ready copy: **28th May 2021** (pdf only)

### Prof. Chris Johnson
![Prof. Chris Johnson](/assets/img/conferences/2021/chris_johnson.png){:class="w3-circle w3-right"}
*Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Engineering and Physical Sciences), Queen’s University Belfast*

Chris Johnson leads the Faculty for Engineering and Physical Sciences at Queen’s University in Belfast. Prior to that he was Head of Computing Science in the University of Glasgow for six years. His research supports the engineering of complex systems; ranging from accident and incident investigation through to contingency planning and risk assessment for European critical infrastructures. The technical focus extends from mathematical reasoning to applied engineering. He has held fellowships from NASA and the US Air Force and has 250 peer-reviewed publications. He worked with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on dynamic integrated risk management techniques to identify, measure and mitigate the social and economic impact that fire and other emergencies can be expected to have on individuals, communities, commerce, industry and the environment. He worked with the US (NIST) data to model different evacuation methods for large public buildings; following the 9/11 and 7/7 attacks. He has advised a range of other UK government departments including BEIS, DfT, DCMS, FCO and the Home Office. In 2020, he is expert witness to the Grenfell Tower inquiry focussing on communications and data issues in the response to the disaster.
