## Australian System Safety Conference

The Australian System Safety Conference (ASSC) is organised by the Australian Safety Critical Systems Association (aSCSa), a Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society.

The theme for the 2025 conference is **experiences and advancements in critical computer systems**. This conference seeks to explore the latest research, development, and practical experiences related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of computer systems where failure can have significant consequences. We welcome both academic papers presenting original research and experience reports detailing real-world case studies and lessons learned. Join us to share your insights and contribute to the advancement of this vital area.

### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) safety-critical systems, real-time systems, embedded systems, fault tolerance, verification techniques, security in critical systems, human factors in critical systems, and emerging challenges in the field.

The 2025 ASSC would like to examine and share the latest experiences, thinking, and state of the art techniques for:
- Development and maintenance of critical computer systems
- Providing assurance of critical computer systems

We invite research papers and project experience to present and engage.

Safety critical areas of interest include:
- Medicine and health (medical devices, e-health systems, etc.)
- Transport
- Defence and Aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy
- Security
- Resource and process industries
- Emergency services

### Submission

Delegates have the option of submitting two types of papers:
1. Refereed Papers by the conference program committee; or
2. Industry Presentations/Papers (not subject to peer review).

Both types of papers are published on the conference website. If sufficient papers are accepted, we may publish in the Journal of Safety and Reliability Society.

- Abstracts should be approximately 250 words.

- Camera-ready copy: **8th October 2025** (pdf only)

### Best Paper Award
The purpose of this award is to encourage research in the science of software/system engineering or the application of that science for safety and/or mission critical software-intensive systems.

One award is available, consisting of $2000 (Australian). For papers with multiple authors, the award will be given to the lead author.
