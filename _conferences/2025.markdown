## Australian System Safety Conference

The Australian System Safety Conference (ASSC) is organised by the Australian Safety Critical Systems Association (aSCSa), a Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society.

The theme for the 2025 conference is yet to be determined.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) systems engineering, safety assurance, human factors, cybersecurity and social engineering, security assurance, reliance, automation, collaboration, teamwork, trust, and assurance standards.

### Topics of Interest

The conference invites original and unpublished works that advance the state-of-the-art in safety and security considerations for the development and operation of safety and security critical systems. We are particularly interested in cross-industry and cross-pollenisation, and looking for papers in:
- Medicine and health (medical devices, e-health systems, etc.)
- Transport
- Defence and Aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy
- Security
- Resource and process industries
- Emergency services

Delegates have the option of submitting two types of papers:
1. Refereed Industry Papers by the conference program committee; or
2. Industry Presentations (not subject to peer review).

Papers and presentations are published on the conference website.

### Submission
- Abstracts should be approximately 250 words.
- For delegates who optionally submit a full paper - papers should be no more than 10 pages.
- A paper template is [available here](/assets/docs/conferences/2025/ASSC%202025%20Template.rtf).
- Paper submissions can be emailed to [secretary@ascsa.org.au](mailto:secretary@ascsa.org.au).

- Submission: **TBD** (rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Camera-ready copy: **TBD** (pdf only)

### Best Paper Award
The purpose of this award is to encourage research in the science of software/system engineering or the application of that science for safety and/or mission critical software-intensive systems.

One award is available, consisting of $2000 (Australian). For papers with multiple authors, the award will be given to the lead author.
