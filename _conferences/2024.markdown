## Submit a Paper

The Australian System Safety Conference (ASSC) is organised by the Australian Safety Critical Systems Association (aSCSa), a Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society.

The theme for the 2024 conference is **Disruptive Technologies**. With systems growing increasingly complex and incorporating novel and disruptive technologies, we are exploring the contribution, challenges, and benefits of disruptive technologies to System Safety and Cybersecurity. As systems increasingly incorporate novel technologies (such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous agents, cloud services, virtual/augmented reality, etc.), are current system safety processes and assurance standards appropriate?

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) systems engineering, safety assurance, human factors, cybersecurity and social engineering, security assurance, reliance, automation, collaboration, teamwork, trust, and assurance standards.

The 2024 ASSC would like to examine and share the latest thinking and state of the art techniques for:
- providing assurance of disruptive technologies; and for
- providing assurance using disruptive technologies.

### Topics of Interest

The conference invites original and unpublished works that advance the state-of-the-art in safety and security considerations for the development and operation of safety and security critical systems. We are particularly interested in cross-industry and cross-pollenisation, and looking for papers in:
- Medicine and health (medical devices, e-health systems, etc.)
- Transport
- Defence and Aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy
- Security
- Resource and process industries
- Emergency services

Delegates have the option of submitting two types of papers:
1. Refereed Industry Papers by the conference program committee; or
2. Industry Presentations (not subject to peer review).

Papers and presentations are published on the conference website.

### Submission
- Abstracts should be approximately 250 words.
- For delegates who optionally submit a full paper - papers should be no more than 10 pages.
- A paper template is [available here](/assets/docs/conferences/2024/ASSC%202024%20Template.rtf).
- Paper submissions can be emailed to [secretary@ascsa.org.au](mailto:secretary@ascsa.org.au).

### Important Dates
- Abstract: **30th June 2024** (text, rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Submission: **25th August 2024** (rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Camera-ready copy: **18th October 2024** (pdf only)

### Best Paper Award
The purpose of this award is to encourage research in the science of software/system engineering or the application of that science for safety and/or mission critical software-intensive systems.

*Associate Professor, Carnegie Mellon University*

Prof. Philip Koopman is an internationally recognized expert on Autonomous Vehicle (AV) safety whose work in that area spans over 25 years. He is also actively involved with AV policy and standards as well as more general embedded system design and software quality. His pioneering research work includes software robustness testing and run time monitoring of autonomous systems to identify how they break and how to fix them. He has extensive experience in software safety and software quality across numerous transportation, industrial, and defense application domains including conventional automotive software and hardware systems. He originated the UL 4600 standard for autonomous system safety issued in 2020. He is a faculty member of the Carnegie Mellon University ECE department where he teaches software skills for mission-critical systems. In 2018 he was awarded the highly selective IEEE-SSIT Carl Barus Award for outstanding service in the public interest for his work in promoting automotive computer-based system safety. In 2022 he was named to the National Safety Council's Mobility Safety Advisory Group. In 2023 he was named the International System Safety Society's Educator of the Year. He is the author of the books: Better Embedded System Software (2010), How Safe is Safe Enough: measuring and predicting autonomous vehicle safety (2022), and The UL 4600 Guidebook (2022).
