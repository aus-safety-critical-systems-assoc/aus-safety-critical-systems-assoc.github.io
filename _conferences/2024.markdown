## Submit a Paper

The Australian System Safety Conference (ASSC) is organised by the Australian Safety Critical Systems Association (aSCSa), a Special Interest Group of the Australian Computer Society.

The theme for the 2024 conference is “Disruptive Technologies”. With systems growing increasingly complex and incorporating novel and disruptive technologies, we are exploring the contribution, challenges, and benefits of disruptive technologies to System Safety and Cybersecurity. As systems increasingly incorporate novel technologies (such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomous agents, cloud services, virtual/augmented reality, etc.), are current system safety processes and assurance standards appropriate?

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) systems engineering, safety assurance, human factors, cybersecurity and social engineering, security assurance, reliance, automation, collaboration, teamwork, trust, and assurance standards.

The 2024 ASSC would like to examine and share the latest thinking and state of the art techniques for:
- providing assurance of disruptive technologies; and for
- providing assurance using disruptive technologies.

### Topics of Interest

The conference invites original and unpublished works that advance the state-of-the-art in safety and security considerations for the development and operation of safety and security critical systems. We are particularly interested in cross-industry and cross-pollenisation, and looking for papers in:
- Medicine and health (medical devices, e-health systems, etc.)
- Transport
- Defence and Aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy
- Security
- Resource and process industries
- Emergency services

Delegates have the option of submitting two types of papers:
1. Refereed Industry Papers by the conference program committee; or
2. Industry Presentations (not subject to peer review).

Papers and presentations are published on the conference website.

### Submission
- Abstracts should be approximately 250 words.
- For delegates who optionally submit a full paper - papers should be no more than 10 pages.
- A paper template is [available here](/assets/docs/conferences/2024/ASSC%202024%20Template.rtf).
- Paper submissions can be emailed to [secretary@ascsa.org.au](mailto:secretary@ascsa.org.au).

### Important Dates
- Abstract: **TBD** (text, rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Submission: **TBD** (rtf, MS-Word or pdf)
- Camera-ready copy: **TBD** (pdf only)

### Best Paper Award
The purpose of this award is to encourage research in the science of software/system engineering or the application of that science for safety and/or mission critical software-intensive systems.
