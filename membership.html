  <p>
    Membership of aSCSa is <b>free</b>. In fact membership is <b>automatic</b> for anyone who attends an ASSC (Australian Systems Safety Conference). If you have not attended an ASSC and would like to become a member, please contact <a href="mailto:secretary@ascsa.org.au" class="w3-text-theme">secretary@ascsa.org.au</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unless you decide to opt out of automatic membership, then aSCSa will keep your email address for the purposes of privately notifying you of one or more of the following:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Upcoming events</b> relating to systems safety (such as the Australian System Safety Conference).</li>
      <li><b>Training courses</b> such as those provided by aSCSa in conjunction with the Australian National or Griffith Universities.</li>
      <li><b>Special lectures</b> that may occur from time to time (especially if being provided by a well-known systems safety entity).</li>
      <li>availability of the latest, free <b>aSCSa newsletter</b> which you can view via this website at your leisure.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is very unlikely that you will receive more than one or two such notifications per month.
